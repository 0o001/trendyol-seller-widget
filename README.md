# Trendyol Seller Widget

## Overview
The Trendyol Seller Widget is a JavaScript utility designed to display key information about sellers on Trendyol, including their name, store score, profile image, number of followers, and a link to their store profile. It's an easy-to-integrate component that enhances the shopping experience by providing valuable seller insights directly to the users.

## Usage
Once the script and styles are added to your project, the widget will automatically populate and display the seller information. Ensure each seller element has a unique `seller-id` attribute corresponding to their Trendyol store ID.

```html
<div class="trendyol-seller-profile" seller-id="112044"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/0o001/trendyol-seller-widget@main/index.js"></script>
